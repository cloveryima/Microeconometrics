## Comments in R are marked with # signs.

### This is the script file for the R workshop developed by Topher Lawton, fall 2018.

##### SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION #####

###Live "tour" of R--using mtcars###
#Goal: demonstrate R syntax with built-in mtcars dataset.

#R comes with a number of built-in datasets, including mtcars.
mtcars

str(mtcars)
summary(mtcars)
head(mtcars)

plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl)

plot(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$mpg)

plot(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$mpg, main= "MPG by number of cylinders", xlab="Cylinders", ylab="Miles per Gallon")


##### SECTION 2: DETAILED PRACTICE #####
#In this section, you'll do the following:
# 1: Load in a CSV data file
# 2: Trim down to data we want
# 3: Explore the data
# 4: Run a visualization

##LOAD CSV##

#confirm working directory #http://rfunction.com/archives/1001
getwd()
#setwd()

#get the CSV into R:
mydata <- read.csv("StateData.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

#Look at your variable
mydata


#NOTE: ctrl+L will clear out your R window, if it's too much visual distraction.

##TRIM DATA##
mypopdata <- mydata[,c(1,3:8)]

#look at your new variable:
mypopdata


##EXPLORE DATA##

#These functions each tell you different things about your data
str(mypopdata) #STRucture
head(mypopdata) #The first few rows
summary(mypopdata) #Basic summary statistics


##VISUALIZE THE DATA##

alaskapop <- mypopdata[2,]

str(alaskapop)

barplot(alaskapop)

barplot(as.matrix(alaskapop[,2:6]))

##### SECTION 3: UNSTRUCTURED PRACTICE #####

#In this time, explore R, and ask whatever questions you might have!

#Basic: repeat the "structured" section for a different state. Can you improve the visualization?

#Intermediate: Create a visualization of the income trends in one state.

#Advanced: Analyse the data and create a visualization that answers a question, such as:
#Which states have the highest median income? Are they static, or do they change positions?
#Which states have the highest and lowest elevation in the US? What about the lowest "highest point" or highest "lowest point"?


##### SECTION 4: WRAP-UP #####

#Thanks for attending this workshop! Please provide feedback--this is a new workshop for us, and it really helps us improve!

#The library is always happy to collaborate with you on your projects. Contact digitalscholarship@georgetown.edu for details.
